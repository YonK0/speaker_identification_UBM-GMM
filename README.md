# How you can use it
- make sure to install the requirement.txt.

- speaker_models.pkl is trained on our voices (me and my friends) so if you want to train it with your own data , just create profile folder in /audio then fill it with .wav files.

- the game.py is gui app that use tkinter as a game that can guess who is the speaker based the trained model (speaker_model.pkl).

- the predict+train.py file is use three modes : train / identification / test precision.
